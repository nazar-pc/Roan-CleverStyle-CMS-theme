## Roan theme ported to CleverStyle CMS

Template was downloaded from http://w3layouts.com/roran-one-page-flat-responsive-web-template and modified in order to work with CleverStyle CMS.

Template itself is not perfect, but looking through commits history you can understand how to convert any HTML template into theme for CleverStyle CMS.

## How to install:
* Create directory `themes/Roan`
* Put everything from this repository there
* Enable theme in administration (sorry, there are no content block in this theme, install "Admin default theme" plugin first)
